[CSRF verification failed]

- What is Cross-site Request Forgery? (CSRF)
It's an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they're currently authenticated. 
e.g. 
1. Embed this CSRF attack code to the document or email to change admin's password, and sent it.
<img src="http://auction.com/changeUserAcoount?id=admin&password=admin" width="0" height="0">
2. If admin user open the document on the browser in which they're currently authenticated with a cookie,
admin's password is changed.

- How to prevent it in Django
Add {% csrf_token %} in your POST form
This token verifies that post request comes from this website
{% endcomment %}
    
<form method="POST" action="{% url 'users:login' %}">
    {% csrf_token %}
    {{form.as_p}}
    <button>Log In</button>
</form>
